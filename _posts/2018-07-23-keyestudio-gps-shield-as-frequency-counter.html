Superficially similar to <a href="https://www.elecrow.com/wiki/images/7/7b/ELEC_GPS_Shield_v1.1.pdf">the elecrow GPS shield</a> at the time of writing it's available from ebay for around $20.
 
<p>I chose this model because it has a ublox GPS module and a header with signals marked &quot;GP&quot; and &quot;EX&quot;.  EX should be external interrupt, and it opens the possibility of a simple GPS-disciplined frequency counter.

<p>It comes with a small antenna, short cable.  One of those godawful laptop style
connectors, and no provision for directly soldering a better one.  Sigh.

<p>Initially, I connected directly to my PC without a microcontroller involved, by
jumpering a 5V FTDI dongle to +5V, GND, TX and RX pins.  In this condition, it
gets a fix after a few minutes on a windowsill with a decent view of the sky

<p>NMEA identification says:
<pre>
$GPTXT,01,01,02,u-blox ag - www.u-blox.com*50
$GPTXT,01,01,02,HW  UBX-G60xx  00040007 FF7FFFFFp*53
$GPTXT,01,01,02,ROM CORE 7.03 (45969) Mar 17 2011 16:18:34*59
$GPTXT,01,01,02,ANTSUPERV=AC SD PDoS SR*20
$GPTXT,01,01,02,ANTSTATUS=DONTKNOW*33
</pre>
and it works with u-center so it might even be a genuine ublox module or at
least a genuine UBX-G60xx chip (but who can say for sure).

<p>Next, I soldered pins to the GP/EX header JP5 and seated it on an
Arduino form-factor Metro M4 with CircuitPython.

<p>After a bit of hacking, the M4 puts the GPS in frequency counter mode, and I've
also connected my <a href="https://www.zachtek.com/product-page/gps-referenced-rf-generator-1mhz-out">ublox-based RF generator</a> to the GPS shield to the EX input.  (Note that the RF
generator's signal is referenced to 3.0V and has a nominal 50 ohm impedance;
the GPS shield lacks level conversion for the EX pin, so connecting 5V could
cause damage)

<p>Placing the GPS in counter mode means sending a CFG-MSG packet to turn on TIM-TM2 reports.  Both of these messages are in UBX binary format.

<p>The main hitch I discovered is that in the ublox TIM-TM2 message, the number of
counts is modulo 2^16 and the message is delivered once a second, so only
frequencies of up to 65535Hz can be counted directly.

<p>However, when you're willing to allow the assumption that the original clock is
close to a specific value, the lost high bits of the count can be restored with
some arithmetic.  As you know the delta time accurately, you know how many
counts are expected within that delta time.  You simply choose 
<em>k</em> such that <em>k*65536+lo_counts</em> is closest to the
expected counts over the given timespan.

<p>The program in its current form compares the most recently received TIM-TM2
packet to the first received one, so you have to drive the module with a fixed
frequency from powerup (or, rather, from when the python code starts running).

<p>After a few minutes of accumulated data, the input frequency remains highly
consistent with being 10MHz (or that they both have the same systematic error
due to both being based on ublox GPS modules and receiving the same GPS
signal):
<pre>
Frequency estimate =   9999999.999537499
15999996466 counts in 1599.999646674s
estimated error [start,end]=62,66ns
  9999999.998737499 ..  10000000.000337500
</pre>

<p>While it seems initially that you could go to infinite gate time, in practice I
don't think that's possible while considering only the first and last packets.
That's because the error between the nominal and actual frequency will
accumulate and eventually exceed 2^15 counts.  When this happens, the code to
restore the count high bits will restore it to a value closer than the true
value.  However, by doing the high bit restoration based on the two most recent
TIM-TM2 packets, even this restriction should be lifted.  

<p>(For a nominal 10MHz clock with a 1ppm systematic error, aka 10Hz, this would
become a problem at around 3276s if I understand properly)

<p>In order to ensure accuracy, my code works with nanoseconds and nanoHz as
Python longs, so floating point precision (and specifically micropython floats
which are just 32-bit values!) does not affect the accuracy of the arithmetic.

<p>My code is too un-polished to be published at this time, and due to the
necessity of hard-coding the nominal frequency I don't plan to publish it at
this time and may not develop it any further.

<p>Minor update: After running overnight, the two GPSes agree to within a very tight margin (on the order of 1e-11 or a microsecond per day):
<pre>
Frequency estimate =  10000000.000036165
334569999530 counts in 33456.999952879s
estimated error [start,end]=62,62ns
  9999999.999999103 ..  10000000.000073228
</pre>
However, some estimates are seen which exclude 10MHz exactly:
<pre>
Frequency estimate =  10000000.000039292
335940000414 counts in 33594.000041268s
estimated error [start,end]=62,62ns
 10000000.000002381 ..  10000000.000076204
</pre>
In infinite accumulation mode there doesn't seem to be any point to
letting the program run for longer than a day or so, as you have to run 10x
as long to get an additional digit of error to disappear.
