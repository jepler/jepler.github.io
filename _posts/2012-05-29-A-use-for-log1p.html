The ANSI C math library includes a few curious functions such as log1p,
which is duly copied (or wrapped) in other languages like Python.
The programmer without a background in numerics may wonder why such a function
is necessary or useful.  Here is a real world example in calculating the
likelihood of a random collision in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack">Birthday Attack</a>.

<p>Wikipedia gives the formula <i>n(p;H) â‰ˆ sqrt(2 H ln(1/(1-p))</i>.  If you directly
transcribe that expression into Python:
<pre>
def n_naive(p,H):
    return max(2,sqrt(2 * H * log(1/(1-p))))
</pre>
and try to reproduce the leftmost columns of that table:
<pre>
def dotable(f):
    bb = (16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 384, 512)
    pp = (1e-18, 1e-15, 1e-12, 1e-9, 1e-6, .001)
    pt = "1e-18 1e-15 1e-12 1e-9 1e-6 .1%".split()

    print "    " + " ".join("%7s" % p for p in pt)
    for b in bb:
        print "%3d" % b,
        for p in pp:
            print "%7.2g" % f(p,2**b),
        print

dotable(n_naive)
</pre>

you'll be disappointed with the results: the left-hand column will be all &quot;2&quot;s,
and the second column will have several values that don't even share one
significant figure with the true value.

<p>The reason is that the subexpression <tt>log(1/(1-p))</tt> is computing
a value very close to 1, then taking its log.  For very small values of 
<tt>p</tt>, <tt>1-p</tt> isn't even different from <tt>p</tt>, leading to
the computation <tt>log(1) == 0</tt>!

<p>This is a perfect opportunity to use <tt>log1p</tt>.  First, use the
identity <i>ln 1/x = -ln x</i> to obtain the expression 
<tt>-log(1-p)</tt> but <tt>-log(1-p) = -log1p(-p)</tt>.  This leads to
the second implementation of the function:
<pre>
def n_clever(p,H):
    return max(2,sqrt(2 * H * -log1p(-p)))

dotable(n_clever)
</pre>
Now, the values shown will match Wikipedia's table.
