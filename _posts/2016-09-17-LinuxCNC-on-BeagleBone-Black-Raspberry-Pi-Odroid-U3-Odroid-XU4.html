For several years, LinuxCNC has compiled and passed its testsuite on
common ARM hardware.

<p>That leaves several missing parts for a good LinuxCNC experience actually running hardware:
<ul>
<li>UIs that perform well
<li>Hardware drivers
<li>Dependable realtime kernels
<li>Prefabricated OS images
<li>Volunteers to maintain these ports
</ul>

<p>As far as UI performance, Mesa with LLVMPipe has made great strides since the
first time I tried AXIS on a BeagleBone, and CPU improvements don't hurt
either; performance on boards from Pi on up is pretty good now.  You can also
choose a previewless UI like touchy or gscreen.  And, of course, remote NML
works again in version 2.7, so you can run your UI on a different machine than
your realtime (though this still has plenty of rough corners / papercuts).

<p>Hardware drivers are beginning to trickle in.  2.7 has hm2_spi, which works
on any preempt-rt with good /dev/spidev hardware drivers.  Unfortunately,
out of 3 systems I've tried (U3, XU4, and PI3), none had good spidev hardware
drivers out of the box.  I have a kernel git with patched U3 and XU4 drivers,
which give good performance on U3 and low to adequate performance on the XU4.
Our master branch has a userspace spi driver for PI-family CPUs (hm2_rpspi),
and a GPIO-only driver for BBB (bb_gpio).  One LinuxCNC developer is working
on a BBB PRU firmware which provides a hostmot2 register-compatible interface,
but that's not available yet.  Based on my experience porting MachineKit's
BBB GPIO driver to LinuxCNC, the difficulty of doing so is low, so if MK
has a hardware driver you'd like to see in LinuxCNC, it's not the worst place
you could start with contributing to LinuxCNC.  Please remember to credit
MachineKit authors by name in your LinuxCNC pull request, and also verify
license compatibility.

<p>For almost all of these boards, you can find various realtime patch sets,
github repositories, debian packages, and so on.  In my experience, they don't
always work, which makes for a frustrating experience.  If you want to use
LinuxCNC 2.7, you need to find a PREEMPT-RT kernel; for our master branch, you
can use PREEMPT-RT, Xenomai, or RTAI, depending whether your hardware driver
needs a syscall interface in realtime (hm2_spi does, for example; hm2_rpspi and
bb_gpio do not)--if you do, then PREEMPT-RT is your only choice.

<p>The Machinekit fork of LinuxCNC offers pre-built realtime kernels and
prefabricated OS images, and in my experience it is easy to to start with their
image, remove machinekit and install LinuxCNC from source.  Unfortunately, I
was unable to find where they publish their kernel source or the scripts they
use to generate the kernel packages and images.  This means that the LinuxCNC
project can't build on their packaging and distro-building work.  I'll update
this space if any little birds tell me where these resources can be found,
because it would be a big help for a volunteer who wanted to get these kernel
packages or OS images distributed from linuxcnc.org with LinuxCNC preinstalled.

<p>That brings me to the last point: linuxcnc.org doesn't compensate anyone for
their work on LinuxCNC.  Current developers have all their time and motivation
eaten up by supporting existing platforms, so without new volunteers, we
simply don't have the time and motivation to make these first-rate, like
we do for standard x86 systems.  Join us and help make the LinuxCNC you want
to use.

<p><b>Update, 2017/3</b>: A little bird has told me that the machinekit images use
<a href="https://github.com/beagleboard/image-builder">these scripts to build
their OS images</a>, but the kernel source remains elusive.  It looks like
they come from <a href="http://repos.rcn-ee.com/debian">http://repos.rcn-ee.com/debian</a> but while there
are debian source packages for e.g., lxqt-sudo there aren't for e.g.,
linux-image-3.8.13-xenomai-r76.
