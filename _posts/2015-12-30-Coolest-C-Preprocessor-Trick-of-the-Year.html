Probably everyone knew about this but me, but here goes anyway. (hat tip:
<a href="https://github.com/google/angle/blob/master/util/shader_utils.h#L19">Google's ANGLE library</a>)

<p>By suitably defining SHADER_SOURCE, you can write your shader program as
though it was just inline source in your larger C(++) program:
<pre>
const char * fs = SHADER_SOURCE
        (
            precision mediump float;
            void main()
            {
                gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
            }
        );
</pre>

<p>The definition of SHADER_SOURCE is simple:
<pre>
#define SHADER_SOURCE(...) # __VA_ARGS__
</pre>

<p>This works as long as your shader is a valid sequence of preprocessor
tokens.  If you need to also use shader language directives like 
<tt>#version</tt>, you will need to write them as strings.  But due to
the way string catenation works, you can do

<p><pre>
const char * fs =
    "#version 100\n"
    SHADER_SOURCE(...);
</pre>
and keep most of the inline shader source outside of strings.
