<a href="https://github.com/jepler/poc">poc</a> is a tool in the vein of
OpenSCAD for creating 3D models in a high level language with a minimum of
boilerplate.  It's now live at github, though I don't know how actively
I'll deveop or maintain it yet.

<p>Here you can see that the input format is fairly terse, and it has
some abilities OpenSCAD doesn't, like selectively filleting certain
edges:

with Difference():
    Box((-50,-50,-50), (50,50,50))
    Cylinder((-100,0,0), (100,0,0), 25)
    Cylinder((0,-100,0), (0,100,0), 25)
    Cylinder((0,0,-100), (0,0,100), 25)
Fillet(12, [e for e in Edges() if e.boundingBox().min.z &gt; 0])
