<a href="https://gnu.org/gnu30/">The GNU project</a> and the Free
Software movement are two of the most important computer-related
things in my life.  At $DAY_JOB we depend critically on many pieces
of GNU software (such as gcc).  This blog is hosted on a system with
a GPL kernel and a GNU userspace, and the blog software itself is
covered by the GPL license.  My everyday computer is a GNU/Linux
system, and my cellphone and tablet have GPL-licensed major
components, such as the operating system kernel.

<p>I personally have contributed thousands of unpaid hours developing
GPL-licensed software, which is my way of repaying everyone else who
has developed Free software.

<p>On the other hand, we haven't come as far as one might wish.  My
everyday computer doesn't function as well without proprietary
drivers, and many devices that should be general purpose computers
don't ship in a mode that allows their owners to install the
software of their choice.  Careful choices are still necessary when
buying hardware, particularly if you insist on an operating system
that consists only of Free software.

<p>Here's hoping that the next 30 years bring more gains for Free
software and the GNU system.  Either way, we'll still be here.
